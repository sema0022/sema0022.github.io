Web Portfolio Assignment

1.  How was the website created?
    The website's creation began in the UX Design course, where mock-ups for mobile, tablet, and desktop were created in Adobe XD. As for the development, I began by using the Bootstrap framework to create the layout, with responsive breakpoints in mind. Afterwards, I used a separate stylesheet to add custom CSS, making the overall theme appear more like my mock-up.  

2.  What challenges were faced? How were they overcome?
    This was my first experience adding custom CSS to a Bootstrap layout. I found some parts could be easily overwritten, while others contained '!important' in the code. In these cases, I decided to work with classes or ids of my own. I'm also relatively new to Bootstrap, so I needed to take some extra time to read the docs and think about the ways I could use it. 
    Formatting the images was also a challenge. I had to figure out how to display my portfolio work both as square thumbnails and as fully viewable images. I ended up exporting the thumbnails directly from my XD file to maintain both the aspect ratio and the optimized file size. For the full images, I worked with Bootstrap's modal component to generate a lightbox view.   

3.  What was learned?
    During this project, I learned about the advantages and the limits of Bootstrap when it comes to developing my own designs. The process also allowed me to see that some aspects of my XD mock-up don't necessarily translate as well on a live website. There are design choices that I probably would reconsider, now that I see the website on my screen.
